/*TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY;

TIME COMPLEXITY;
    TIME COMPLEXITY IS THE TIME REQUIRED TO RUN AN ALGORITHM.
* WE CANT CALCULATE THE TIME COMPLEXITY IN SECONDS, AND MILLI SECONDS, AND MICRO SECONDS. 

* THATS WHY WE USE ASYMPTOTIC NOTATION.(O)

THETA{}- AVERAGE CASE SCENERIO;
OMEGA{}-WORST CASE SCENERIO;

WHY WE NEED TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY ?

to calculate the performanceand optimization of an algorithm we use time and space complexity.

1. LINEAR- 0(n)- ex; print n natural numbers.
2. QUADRATIC- 0(n2)- ex; printing 2d array.(2 loops n times).
3. CONSTANT- 0(1). if time complexity is not dependent on input. ex- printing hello world.
4.CUBIC-0(n3)- ex; printing 3d arrays(3 loops n times).
5.LOGARITHMIC- log(n)-input is reducing by half. ex; binary search.
6.EXPONENTIAL- 2^n.
7.FACTORIAL- n!.

SPACE COMPLEXITY;
    SPACE COMPLEXITY IS THE SPACE REQUIRED TO RUN AN ALGORITHM.

note; extra spaces taken by an algorithm are called auxilary space.

AUXILARY SPACE + INPUT SIZE = SPACE COMPLEXITY.

ASYMPTOTIC NOTATION;    
0(n)-linear.
0(n2)- quadratic.
0(1)- constant.
log(n)- logarithmic.
n!-factorial.
2^n- exponential.
0(n3)- cubic.
